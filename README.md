Files in this repository show the steps taken during the machine learning and artificial intelligence course at Merrimac College.
The final project was completed in 3 segments: Analytic Plan, Preliminary Results and Final Report.
During the course of this project, I built a dense, feed-forward neural network to be used as a predictive model.
I did this by setting up a virtual workspace in R, using tensorflow and keras tools.

Course description from the syllabus:
This course offers students an introduction to machine learning and artificial intelligence, focusing on
supervised and unsupervised learning. More specifically, students will learn the proper machine
learning workflows and techniques for extracting critical insights from data, and then apply their
knowledge to real-world data sets. The course is meant to offer an overview of this highly complex
field, focusing on key intuition behind established approaches and hands-on applications of
techniques. Topics include data pre-processing, regression and classification using deep learning
models, evaluation of classifiers, principal component analysis, and clustering.
